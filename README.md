Step 1: Set Up Kafka with Zookeeper
Install Docker:

Ensure that Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine. This simplifies the setup process for Kafka and Zookeeper.
Create a Docker Compose File:

Create a file named docker-compose.yml in the backend/ directory with the following content:
ersion: '3'
services:
  zookeeper:
    image: wurstmeister/zookeeper:3.4.6
    ports:
      - "2181:2181"

  kafka:
    image: wurstmeister/kafka:latest
    ports:
      - "9092:9092"
    environment:
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: INSIDE://kafka:9092,OUTSIDE://localhost:9092
      KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP: INSIDE:PLAINTEXT,OUTSIDE:PLAINTEXT
      KAFKA_LISTENERS: INSIDE://0.0.0.0:9092,OUTSIDE://0.0.0.0:9092
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper

  postgres:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: polling
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
Start Kafka and Zookeeper:
Navigate to the backend directory and run the following command:
docker-compose up -d
This command will start Zookeeper, Kafka, and PostgreSQL in detached mode.



Step 2: Develop the Polling API
Set Up the Project Structure:
Create the necessary directories and files as outlined in the project structure in the previous sections.
Install Dependencies:
In the backend directory, run:
npm init -y
npm install express pg kafka-node dotenv
Create Database Schema:
Connect to the PostgreSQL database and execute the SQL commands to create the polls and options tables.
Implement the Polling API:
Create the necessary controllers, services, and routes to handle the creation of polls, voting, and retrieving results.



Step 3: Real-Time Poll Updates with WebSockets
Set Up WebSocket Server:
In the websocket directory, implement a WebSocket server that listens for incoming connections and broadcasts updates to connected clients.
Integrate WebSocket with Polling API:
Modify the polling API to emit events over WebSocket when a poll is created or when votes are cast.

const producer = kafka.producer();
await producer.connect();
await producer.send({
    topic: 'polls',
    messages: [{ value: JSON.stringify({ pollId, question, options }) }],
});




Step 4: Implement Kafka Producers and Consumers
Create Kafka Producers:
In the pollService.js, implement Kafka producers that send messages when polls are created and when votes are cast.
Create Kafka Consumers:
Set up Kafka consumers that listen for messages
